# README-Generator
Using inquirer to build a professional README file.

## Features
* prompts to build a professional README file.
* choice of license with badge.
* prebuilt styling with minimal user input.

## Reasoning
Enacting a README quickly and efficiently.

## Challenges & Process
1. The template literal was difficult initially but easy to iterate on and change things to see if they worked.
2. I wasn't super familiar with markdown syntax, but I am now.
3. Using a promise to write the file helped me build on my fledgling understanding of promises.
